Chris,

I'm a screenwriter living in Austin, Texas, currently working as a software engineer. When I heard your episode of The Moth one day on the way to work, I knew I wanted to turn it into a screenplay. When I got home, I read any other versions of your story that I could find, and one genuinely terrible Buzzfeed article. I'm sure you've probably been contacted by others about this before, but I figured this was worth a shot. I think I'm uniquely qualified to help write your story, as a comedy writer with a degree in Bioinformatics and an interest in data science. I'm more likely than most to understand the intricacies of your story, and more likely to value the same pieces of your story as you. I'm very excited about this script, and I'd love the opportunity to talk about working with you to make it.

Let me know if this is or isn't something you'd like to continue discussing. On the off chance that you're in Austin ever, I'd love the chance to meet up with you and chat this over. At the very least, I'd just like to say that your story and your storytelling were the best I've heard on any episode of The Moth so far. 

I'm sorry for contacting you through github like this, but it was the only way I could find. 

Best,
Ben Cody
